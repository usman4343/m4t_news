Why do I need this?
This free Link Removal Tool is NOT for getting rid of backlinks TO your site (unless the other site uses this plugin to remove the links).  This plugin is to remove all links on YOUR site for a defined URL. For example, if you get a lot of emails from other sites wanting you to stop linking to their site.  

This plugin makes it FAR easier to remove all hyperlinks to their URL, instantly.  To do this manually would take many hours to check every page on your site to see if their link is there.  Use this plugin you can instantly know that they are all removed.  You might also want to make sure you stop linking out to some (maybe) dodgy other sites.  Or you might want to completely clean up your site if it has too many outgoing links. 

How do I use it?

1. Type or paste in the URL into the “URL” box.  It is best to use the root domain, without the “http://” part and without the “www.” part – i.e. only just "domain.com" (without the ” quote marks)
2. Click “Clear all posts”.
Done!
